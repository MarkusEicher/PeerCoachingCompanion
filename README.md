# PeerCoachingCompanion

## Introduction

### What is PeerCoachingCompanion?

PeerCoachingCompanion is a solution for Peer Workers in the Healthcare sector. Peer Workers are Coaches, Trainers, and Mentors who are working with clients going through health crisis or are recovering from it.

One aspect of the training to become a Peer Worker is to learn how to professionally lead coaching sessions following a certain framework. This is done by providing coaching sessions that are structured in a way that helps to improve the health and reduce the stress of their clients.

The goal of this project is to provide a platform for Peer Workers to learn how to lead coaching sessions. It will leverage Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with optimized language models to help Peer Workers learning how to lead coaching sessions. Ideally this can be achieved with a state-of-the-art machine learning model and a user interface that allows natural language processing and works in both directions. The bot should be able to take the role of the Peer Worker as well as the role of a client with a certain health issue or personal problem.

Project setup follows next.
