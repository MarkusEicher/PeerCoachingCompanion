# PeerCoachingCompanion

## Introduction

### What is PeerCoachingCompanion?

PeerCoachingCompanion is a solution for Peer Workers in the Healthcare sector. Peer Workers are Coaches, Trainers, and Mentors who are working with clients going through health crisis or are recovering from it.

One aspect of the training to become a Peer Worker is to learn how to professionally lead coaching sessions following a certain framework. This is done by providing coaching sessions that are structured in a way that helps to improve the health and reduce the stress of their clients.

The goal of this project is to provide a platform for Peer Workers to learn how to lead coaching sessions. It will leverage Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with optimized language models to help Peer Workers learning how to lead coaching sessions. Ideally this can be achieved with a state-of-the-art machine learning model and a user interface that allows natural language processing and works in both directions. The bot should be able to take the role of the Peer Worker as well as the role of a client with a certain health issue or personal problem.

### Why does this project exist?

My name is Markus Eicher and I am currently in training to become a Peer Worker in the Healthcare sector. I want to get accredited to be allowed to work with people going through a health crisis or another personal problem. During my training with myPeer.ch I found out, that having enough practice in leading coaching sessions is crucial to become proficient in the field. This is why I have created this project. Being able to practice at any time, without having to worry about finding a partner to do so, will be a big benefit for all learners in this field.

While it is not an easy goal to achieve, I still won't miss to try to do it. I am commited to do my part. Be it as contributor or as maintainer, enabling others that are more proficient in coding than myself.

I invite you to join me and help to make this happen. Every single contribution, no matter if it is a rockstar code part or correcting a typo is very appreciated and welcome. Even leaving a comment or critique helps to make this project better.

Let's do this! üöÄ
